# Container-agnostic service providers

**Work in progress.**

This project is part of the [container-interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) group. It tries to find a solution for cross-framework modules (aka bundles) by the means of container-agnostic configuration.

## Background

Three main alternatives were identified to solve this problem:

- standard PHP objects/interfaces representing container definitions
- standard container configuration format (e.g. XML, â€¦)
- standard service providers

The first solution that container-interop members tried to implement was [a set of standard PHP interfaces for container definitions](https://github.com/container-interop/definition-interop). While this solution is working, it has a few limitations and it is complicated to explain, understand and use.

There were then discussions about a standard configuration format (for example in XML), which has the advantage of being slightly easier to understand and use for module developers. This work has not be formalized yet because of the amount of work needed. This approach would also suffers from a few of the limitations identified in the first approach. It would also requires the inclusion in the standard of many specific features: the standard must define many different ways for how objects can be created and dependencies injected. That makes the standard complex to define, and would force all containers (even simple ones) to support all the features.

This repository contains a proposition for **standard service providers** (service providers are PHP components that provide container entries). This approach has turned out to be simpler on many level:

- the standard is much simpler, which means it is easier to explain and understand
- it is easier to use as it relies on plain old PHP code
- it is easier to implement support in containers

## Goal of this project

This project is currently at its experimental phase: the goal is to try this standard in frameworks, containers and modules and iterate until it can be considered as a viable solution for **container-agnostic configuration**.

Until a 1.0.0 release the code in this repository is not stable. Expect changes breaking backward compatibility between minor versions (0.1.x -> 0.2.x).

## Usage

To declare a service provider, simply implement the `ServiceProvider` interface.

```php
use Interop\Container\ServiceProvider;

class MyServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'my_service' => 'getMyService',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getMyService(ContainerInterface $container, callable $getPrevious = null)
    {
        $dependency = $container->get('my_other_service');
    
        return new MyService($dependency);
    }
}
```

The `getServices()` static method must return a list of all container entries the service provider wishes to register:

- the key is the entry name
- the value is the name of the static method that will return the entry, aka the **factory method**

Factory methods must be public and static in the service provider class. They accept the following parameters:

- the container (instance of `Interop\Container\ContainerInterface`)
- a callable that returns the previous entry if overriding a previous entry, or `null` if not

The only difference between defining an entry from scratch or overriding/extending a previous entry is that the `$getPrevious` parameter will be either a `callable` or `null`. Factories are free to *use it or ignore it* if it's not `null`.

If you know you will not be using the `$container` parameter or the `$getPrevious` parameter, you can omit them:

```php
    public static function getMyService()
    {
        return new MyService();
    }
```

### Values (aka parameters)

A service provider can provide PHP objects (services) as well as any value. Simply return the value you wish from factory methods.

### Aliases

To alias a container entry to another, you can get the aliased entry from the container and return it:

```php
class MyServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'my_service' => 'createMyService',
            'alias' => 'resolveAlias',
        ];
    }
    
    // ...
    
    public static function resolveAlias(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        return $container->get('my_service');
    }
}
```

### Entry overriding

Overriding an entry defined in another service provider is as easy as defining it again.

Module A:

```php
class A implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'foo' => 'getFoo',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getFoo()
    {
        return 'abc';
    }
}
```

Module B:

```php
class B implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'foo' => 'getFoo',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getFoo()
    {
        return 'def';
    }
}
```

If you register the service providers in the correct order in your container (A first, then B), then the entry `foo` will be `'def'` because B's definition will override A's.

### Entry extension

Extending an entry before it is returned by the container is very similar to overriding it.

Module A:

```php
class A implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'logger' => 'getLogger',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getLogger()
    {
        return new Logger;
    }
}
```

Module B:

```php
class B implements ServiceProvider
{
    public static function getServices()
    {
        return [
            'logger' => 'getLogger',
        ];
    }
    
    public static function getLogger(ContainerInterface $container, callable $getPrevious = null)
    {
        // Get the previous entry
        $previous = $getPrevious();

        // Register a new log handler
        $previous->addHandler(new SyslogHandler());
    
        // Return the object that we modified
        return $previous;
    }
}
```

If you register the service providers in the correct order in your container (A first, then B), the logger will be first created by `A` then a new handler will be registered on it by `B`.

## FAQ

#### Why static methods?

It comes from the assumption that container configuration is stateless, i.e. it doesn't depend on anything.

If container configuration is not stateless, it introduces problems for compiled containers (e.g. Symfony) or containers that perform caching (e.g. PHP-DI). Using static methods somewhat guarantees everything to be stateless, which cannot be guaranteed otherwise.

Also static methods are easy to call, no need to instantiate any object which, when building a container in every request, is a bit of a performance advantage compared to having to create new objects for no reason.

#### Why does the `getServices()` method returns an array of function names instead of an array of callables?

An array of callables means anonymous functions could be returned, which is hard to adapt to compiled or cached containers.

Even if we explicitly forbid closures (which would be weird in the first place), invokable objects or object methods would also hard to adapt with compiled/cached containers.

So the only callables that would really be allowed would be:

- function name
- static method (['Class', 'method'])

It seems a bit weird to use function for this use case (especially since they are not autoloadable). So we end up with static methods.

Of course, we could allow the static methods to be in another class than the service provider, but it seems generally a good idea to have the services created in the service provider.

#### Why inject a callable instead of the previous entry directly in factories?

In a first version, service provider factories received the previous entry directly as a second parameter:

```php
    public static function getMyService(ContainerInterface $container, $previous = null)
    {
        // ...
    }
```

That caused 2 problems:

- it was inefficient since it caused the container to resolve all the previous entries that might exist, even when they were overridden by another service provider
- when the entry name was a class name, autowiring containers would try to resolve the previous entry using autowiring: when some parameters could not be resolved by the container, there would be exceptions

By injecting a callable that returns the previous entry, that makes it *lazily loaded*. That is both more efficient and avoids most problems with autowiring containers.

For a more detailed explanation you can read the full discussion in the [issue #9](https://github.com/container-interop/service-provider/issues/9).

## Puli integration

The Puli integration is completely optional and not required to use this standard. It is only here to facilitate usage with Puli.

Using Puli, packages can declare the service providers they contain. Then, containers can automatically retrieve the list of service providers.

This package provides a [Puli *binding type*](http://docs.puli.io/en/latest/discovery/getting-started.html): `container-interop/service-provider`. Modules using Puli and implementing this standard can register service providers (fully qualified class names) through this binding type.

This way, frameworks or applications based on Puli can discover service providers automatically.

Service provider authors can register their service provider with those 2 simple steps:

In `composer.json`, add the following dependencies in `require-dev`:

```json
{
    ...
    "require-dev": {
        "puli/cli": "^1.0",
        "puli/composer-plugin": "^1.0"
    },
    ...
}
```

Then, simply use Puli's `bind` command:

```sh
vendor/bin/puli bind --class Acme\\Foo\\MyServiceProvider container-interop/service-provider
```
